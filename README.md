# Notebook: [ Week #8 - Deploying Streamlit App]

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ We strongly suggest that you at least go through the following materials in our notes before proceeding with this hands-on session:
- *"Password Protect the Streamlit App"*
- *"Intro to Git and GitHub (Version Control)"*
- *"Deploying Streamlit App on Streamlit Community Cloud*

-----

ðŸ’Ž The **best way** to go through this hands-on:
- Try not to watch the step-by-step videos unless you get stuck for more than 15-20 minutes.

- At this point, you should be comfortable with fiddling with the code and resolvings errors on your own.

# Task 1: Setting Up the Project Files

1. Make sure you have set up the following:
    - A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
    - Install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/) on your local machine
    - A [Streamlit Account](https://streamlit.io/cloud)


2. Download a copy of the completed code of Topic 7 (Notebook Part 2) from the URL below onto your laptop.
    - URL: [abc-notes.data.tech.gov.sg/resources/data/week-08.zip](abc-notes.data.tech.gov.sg/resources/data/week-08.zip)
    - Unzip the downloaded file
    - The folder that contains all the unzipped file will the `project folder` for this hands-on.

3. Set up a virtual environment (`venv`) in the  `project folder` and install the required packages:
    - openai
    - streamlit
    - pandas
    - python-dotenv
    - tiktoken

4. Copy your `.env` file into the folder. It must at least contain the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable.

# Task 2: Password Protect the Streamlit App

1. Create the file that store the password
    - Create a new folder called `.streamlit` at the root of the project folder
    - Add a new file `secrets.toml` in the new folder
    - Add this line to the file `password = "<your app password>"`
    - Note that this `toml` will only be used for local development and will be excluded from the GitHub repository.
    - The `passsword` will be set separately in the Streamlit Community Cloud settings.

---


2. Add a new Python script `utility.py` in the `helper_functions` folder. The script will contain the following code:

    ```Python
    import streamlit as st  
    import random  
    import hmac  
    
    # """  
    # This file contains the common components used in the Streamlit App.  
    # This includes the sidebar, the title, the footer, and the password check.  
    # """  
    
    
    def check_password():  
        """Returns `True` if the user had the correct password."""  
        def password_entered():  
            """Checks whether a password entered by the user is correct."""  
            if hmac.compare_digest(st.session_state["password"], st.secrets["password"]):  
                st.session_state["password_correct"] = True  
                del st.session_state["password"]  # Don't store the password.  
            else:  
                st.session_state["password_correct"] = False  
        # Return True if the passward is validated.  
        if st.session_state.get("password_correct", False):  
            return True  
        # Show input for password.  
        st.text_input(  
            "Password", type="password", on_change=password_entered, key="password"  
        )  
        if "password_correct" in st.session_state:  
            st.error("ðŸ˜• Password incorrect")  
        return False
    ```

---

3. Add this code block into any of the scripts that render a Streamlit page that need to be password protected:

    ```Python
    import streamlit as st  
    from helper_functions.utility import check_password  
    
    # Check if the password is correct.  
    if not check_password():  
        st.stop()
    ```

---

4. Try the app locally to see if everything is working as expected.

-----

1. Initialize a new repository in the `week-08` folder.

    - Within VS Code, initalize a new repository in the `week-08` folder.
    
    - Alternatively, you can also initialize a new repository in the `week-08` folder using GitHub Desktop.

---

2. Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project folder.

    - Add the following lines to the file:
        ```
        # Byte-compiled / optimized / DLL files
        __pycache__/
        *.py[cod]
        *$py.class

        # Virtual environments
        venv/
        env/
        ENV/
        .venv/
        .env

        # Distribution / packaging
        build/
        dist/
        *.egg-info/

        # VS Code
        .vscode/
        # PyCharm
        .idea/

        # Streamlit
        .streamlit/secrets.toml

        ```

---

3. Commit the changes to the GitHub repository.

    - Within VS Code, stage the changes and commit the changes with a message.

    - Alternatively, you can also commit the changes using GitHub Desktop.

---

4. Push the changes to the GitHub repository.

    - You may need to set up the remote repository if you haven't done so.

    - Alternatively, you can also push the changes using GitHub Desktop.

# Task 4: Create a New Streamlit App on Streamlit Community Cloud

- Head over to the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and log in.
- You may need to allow Streamlit to access your GitHub account, if you haven't done so.
- Click on the "New app" button.
- Select the repository that you have pushed to GitHub.
- Click on the `Advanced settings`
    - Set the `password` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the `Secrets` section.
- Click on the `Deploy` button.

# Task 5: Specifying the Packages Needed and the Way API Keys are being Read

- You will get an error message from the Streamlit app.

- This is because we have not yet:

    - Specified the packages needed for the app to run.
    
    - Change the way the API keys are being read in our Script


---

### Step 1: Add a `requirements.txt` file in the root of the project folder.
- run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal to generate the file.


---

### Step 2: Modify the way the API keys are being read in the script in `llm.py` file.

```Python
Original Code:
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
import tiktoken

load_dotenv('.env')


# Pass the API Key to the OpenAI Client
client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

# Some other code here are omitted for brevity
```

---
<br>

- Here is the new code

```Python
import os
import streamlit as st
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from openai import OpenAI
import tiktoken


if load_dotenv('.env'):
   # for local development
   OPENAI_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
else:
   OPENAI_KEY = st.secrets['OPENAI_API_KEY']


# Pass the API Key to the OpenAI Client
client = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_KEY)
# Some other code here are omitted for brevity
```

---

### Step 3: **Commit and push** the changes to the GitHub repository.
